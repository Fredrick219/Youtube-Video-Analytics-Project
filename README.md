# Youtube-Video-Analytics-Project
The primary objective of this project is to utilize the Youtube API to gather data from my YouTube channel and subsequently store it in AWS DBS. Subsequently, I will connect to the database to conduct analysis on the performance of my YouTube channel videos, considering metrics such as view count, like count, comment count, and more.
